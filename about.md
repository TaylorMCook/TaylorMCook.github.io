I am an experienced executive with a strong track record of program and project success. I excel at building and leading strong, diverse, collaborative teams to understand and address ambiguous problems. My professional expertise includes state-level health and human services, public enterprise IT planning, and strengthening local food systems. 

Recently I have turned my curiosity and attention to the intersections of housing, homelessness, and healthcare. I want to understand these interrelated issues and how these disparate systems can work together to ensure that everyone has their basic needs met.
