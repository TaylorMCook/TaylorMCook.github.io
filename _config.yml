# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

I am a Doctoral student in Community and Regional Planning at the Universtiy of Texas. My resaech is at the intersection of housing, homelessness, and healthcare. After years of public and non-profit service I am eager to use a variety of methods to explore these issues and collaborate with front line workers and people with lived experience to identify and test solutions. This website about my work, research, and interests. There may also be some photos of my dogs, adventures with my husband, and the occasional vegan recipe.
